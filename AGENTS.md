# AGENTS.md — Django + Bootstrap Workshop Project

## Purpose

A Persian, right-to-left web product built with Django and Bootstrap in one
codebase: Django renders pages on the server, Bootstrap styles them. It is
built in a workshop by a non-technical product owner who does not write code.
The project runs locally only. Do not invent features or behavior that the
user or an approved spec did not describe.

## Current Boundary

Build only what the current request or approved change asks for. Out of scope
unless the user explicitly asks:

- Deployment, hosting, domains, HTTPS, production settings, Docker, CI.
- Sign-up, login, password reset, roles, per-user data. The only account is a
  local superuser the user creates for the Django admin.
- Email, payments, file uploads, external APIs, or any network request made by
  the running product.
- A separate frontend app, a REST API, JavaScript frameworks, or a Node.js
  build step. Bootstrap is used as ready-made local static files.
- Python packages other than Django unless the user approves; check
  `pyproject.toml` first.

Never describe this project as production-ready or secure: it has no login, so
anyone who can open the local address can change the data.

A spec, plan, or task cannot override this boundary. If one needs something
out of scope, stop and report the conflict.

## Read Before Editing

1. This file, completely.
2. `product.md` — approved product context, not approval to build every
   planned capability.
3. `design.md` — for every visual change.
4. `openspec/config.yaml`, the relevant specs in `openspec/specs`, and the
   active change in `openspec/changes` (proposal, specs, design, tasks).
5. The relevant Django app and the shared `templates/` before creating
   anything new.

If the coding tool reads another instruction file (for example `CLAUDE.md`),
that file only points here (`@AGENTS.md`); do not duplicate rules in it.

## Workshop Setup Order

1. Prompt 1 (`prompts/prompt-1-docs-and-django.md`): fill `product.md` from
   the owner's idea, align all documents, and build the Django + Bootstrap
   base with empty `static/fonts/` and `static/brand/`.
2. The owner places font files in `static/fonts/` and the logo in
   `static/brand/`.
3. Prompt 2 (`prompts/prompt-2-design-system.md`): tokens, font, logo,
   shared components, and the `/design-system/` page.
4. Every product capability after that goes through the OpenSpec cycle.

## Talking With the User

The user is a non-technical product owner. Every OpenSpec command and direct
request is a conversation in plain Persian.

- Reply in fluent, friendly, everyday Persian. Keep file names, commands, and
  code in English. Explain an unavoidable technical term in one short phrase.
- Ask only product questions: who uses it, what they see and do, which rules
  and states apply, what is out of scope. Decide technical details yourself
  from this file, `design.md`, and the existing code; mention them briefly.
- Ask at most three questions at a time, with short options and one marked
  «پیشنهادی». If the user answers «نمی‌دانم», propose a safe default and ask
  for confirmation.
- Never ask for passwords, tokens, or secrets. The user types the superuser
  password in their own terminal.
- End each reply with: what was done, what to open or try, and the exact next
  command or prompt.

## Spec-Driven Development (OpenSpec)

- Use the cycle for: a new feature or page with real behavior, a change in how
  something works, new or changed stored data, access rules.
- Use a direct request for: setup and infrastructure, the design system, text,
  color, or spacing tweaks, a bug whose correct behavior is already known.
- Cycle: `/opsx:explore` (optional) → `/opsx:propose` → user review and
  update → `/opsx:apply` (fresh conversation) → user testing →
  `openspec validate --strict <change>` → `/opsx:verify` → `/opsx:archive`.
- Proposal and spec prose are plain Persian. OpenSpec headings, SHALL/MUST,
  GIVEN/WHEN/THEN, code, paths, and commands stay English. A change's
  `design.md` and `tasks.md` are English.
- A change's `design.md` is its technical plan only; the shared visual system
  is the root `design.md`.
- No code during propose or update. Mark a task done only after its work and
  checks pass. Do not archive with an unresolved CRITICAL verify finding.

## Project Structure

```text
manage.py  pyproject.toml  AGENTS.md  design.md  product.md
config/                 # Django project: settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, asgi.py
templates/
  base.html             # shared layout (RTL, Bootstrap, navbar, footer)
  components/           # reusable partials: alert, card, form-field, ...
static/
  css/theme.css         # tokens and Bootstrap overrides from design.md
  css/vendor/           # bootstrap.rtl.min.css (local copy)
  js/vendor/            # bootstrap.bundle.min.js (local copy)
  fonts/                # font files the user placed here
  brand/                # optional logo
core/                   # design-system page and shared pages
  templates/core/design-system.html
<feature>/              # one Django app per product feature
openspec/               # config.yaml, specs/, changes/
```

- One app per feature: `uv run python manage.py startapp <feature>`, then add
  it to `INSTALLED_APPS`. Keep `config/urls.py` thin (include each app).
- Markup used by two or more pages goes in `templates/components/`.

## Code Rules

- Python files snake_case; templates, CSS, JS, fonts kebab-case where we name
  them. Files roughly 200 lines or fewer.
- Prefer small class-based generic views and `ModelForm`. Business rules live
  in models or forms, not templates.
- Data-changing views use POST with `{% csrf_token %}` and redirect after
  success. Delete always asks for confirmation.
- Show success and failure with `django.contrib.messages`.
- Register each model in `admin.py` with a Persian `verbose_name`.
- Model changes: `makemigrations` then `migrate`. Never edit an applied
  migration; add a new one. `db.sqlite3` is not committed.
- No secrets in code or chat; if ever needed, a git-ignored `.env`.

## Django Settings

- `LANGUAGE_CODE = "fa"`, `TIME_ZONE = "Asia/Tehran"`, `USE_I18N = True`,
  `USE_TZ = True`.
- SQLite. `DEBUG = True` is acceptable (local only).
- `TEMPLATES["DIRS"]` includes `templates/`; `STATICFILES_DIRS` includes
  `static/`.
- Jalali dates only if the user asks; a Jalali library needs approval.

## Tooling and Git

- Python and packages only with uv: `uv run python manage.py ...`. No pip.
- The user runs `uv run python manage.py runserver` in their own terminal. Do
  not leave a server running; tell the user what to open or refresh.
- The user creates the superuser (`createsuperuser`) themselves.
- Bootstrap and font files may be downloaded once during setup into
  `static/`; the running product never loads anything from the internet.
- Commit after each verified step (the message the prompt gives, or a short
  conventional one). No remote; never push.
- If Git has no identity, set a repository-local one only
  (`Workshop Participant` / `participant@workshop.local`).
- Never discard, reset, or rewrite commits without the user's explicit choice.

## Design and RTL

- `<html lang="fa" dir="rtl">`, `bootstrap.rtl.min.css`, logical utilities
  (`ms-*`, `me-*`, `ps-*`, `pe-*`, `text-start`, `text-end`).
- Colors, radius, and font come from `design.md` tokens via CSS variables in
  `static/css/theme.css`. No hard-coded colors, no second visual system.
- Bootstrap components first; custom CSS only in `theme.css`.
- Every page works on phone and desktop, with visible keyboard focus and
  labels connected to fields.
- User-facing text is Persian, without demo or sample-data wording unless the
  user asks.

## Verification

Verify in proportion to the change and report real results in plain Persian:

- Template or style: render the page and check it at phone and desktop width,
  RTL, and Persian text.
- Model, form, view, or URL: `uv run python manage.py check`,
  `uv run python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run`,
  `uv run python manage.py test`.
- Settings or dependencies: also render the home page with Django's test
  client.
- OpenSpec files: `openspec validate --strict <change>`.
- Say plainly what you did not check.

## Definition of Done

- Behavior matches the approved scenarios, including empty and error states.
- Checks pass; migrations created and applied; no unused code.
- `AGENTS.md`, `design.md`, and `product.md` still match reality.
- The user was told in plain Persian what to open and try.

When a structural fact changes (folders, packages, commands, rules), update
this file in the same change and tell the user.
